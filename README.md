Inspired by [ember-concurrency](http://ember-concurrency.com/).

A library for encapsulating asynchronous operations and managing concurrency for Vue and Composition API.

vue-concurrency aims to provide a reasonable abstraction for performing asynchronous operations. It reduces boilerplate code, provides reliable derived state and allows new approaches to techniques like throttling, debouncing, polling. Read more about why and how in the docs:
